# DSUTILITY

**Powerful PDF Tools. 100% Private. Runs in Your Browser.**

DSUTILITY is a suite of client-side PDF tools — merge, split, compress, sign, edit, redact, OCR, and more. Everything runs in the user's browser. Nothing is uploaded. There is no backend, no database, no accounts.

---

## What's in the box

A single-page-app-like static site built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No build step, no bundler, no framework. Open `index.html` in a browser and it works.

### Tools included (25 total)

**Organize:** Merge, Split, Rotate, Delete Pages, Extract Pages, Crop, N-up
**Convert:** JPG→PDF, PDF→JPG, HTML→PDF
**Edit & Annotate:** PDF Editor (overlay-based), Add Text, Add Image, Sign, Watermark, Highlight, Page Numbers, Header/Footer, Redact, Annotate
**Optimize:** Compress, Metadata Editor
**Security:** Protect (password), Unlock (known password)
**OCR:** OCR PDF (English + Hindi, powered by Tesseract.js)

### Site pages

Homepage, Tools directory, 15 long-form blog articles, About, Contact, FAQ, Privacy Policy, Terms, Disclaimer, Cookie Policy, DMCA, 404.

## Architecture

### Zero backend

DSUTILITY is a **static site**. There is no server-side component, no API, no database. Host it on GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, Cloudflare Pages, or any web host that serves static files.

### All processing happens client-side

Files are read via the browser's `FileReader` API, processed with JavaScript libraries running in the browser, and offered as downloads via Blob URLs. No file content is ever transmitted.

You can verify this:
1. Open DevTools → Network tab → clear requests → use any tool. No outgoing request carries your file.
2. Load a tool page, disconnect from the internet, use the tool. It still works.

### Libraries used

| Library | Purpose | Version | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| pdf-lib | PDF creation and manipulation | 1.17.1 | unpkg |
| pdf.js | PDF rendering (for previews & rasterization) | 3.11.174 | cdnjs |
| Tesseract.js | OCR (lazy-loaded) | 5.0.5 | jsdelivr |
| jsPDF | PDF generation (compression, HTML→PDF) | 2.5.1 | cdnjs |
| JSZip | ZIP packaging (split, PDF→JPG) | 3.10.1 | cdnjs |
| FileSaver.js | Download helper | 2.0.5 | cdnjs |

All are open-source and widely used. None of them transmit file content.

### Web Workers

Heavy PDF operations (merge, rotate, delete, split) run inside a Web Worker (`js/pdf-worker.js`) so the UI stays responsive. The worker loads pdf-lib via `importScripts` and communicates via `postMessage`.

### Configuration

All site-wide settings live in `js/config.js`. This is the **only file most deployers need to edit**. See the section below.

---

## Quick start (local)

Because there's no build step, you can run DSUTILITY with any static file server:

```bash
# Option 1: Python (comes installed on most systems)
cd dspdf
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Option 2: Node.js
npx serve .
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000`.

⚠️ **Don't** open `index.html` directly via `file:///` — some browsers restrict `fetch` and service workers in that mode. Use a local server.

---

## Configuration — `js/config.js`

Open `js/config.js` and edit the marked values:

```javascript
window.DSUTILITY_CONFIG = {
  siteName: "DSUTILITY",

  // 👉 If your site URL is https://username.github.io/dspdf/
  //    set basePath to "/dspdf/"
  // 👉 If your site is at the root of a domain (e.g. https://dspdf.com/)
  //    set basePath to "/"
  basePath: "/",

  // 👉 Your full public URL, WITH trailing slash.
  siteUrl: "https://dsutility.pages.dev/",

  // 👉 Your real contact email. Shown on Contact page.
  contactEmail: "dstechnocomp@gmail.com",

  // 👉 Ads: keep false until AdSense approves your site.
  adsenseEnabled: false,
  adsenseClient: "",

  // 👉 Analytics: optional. Leave off for full privacy.
  analyticsEnabled: false,
  analyticsId: "",

  version: "1.0.0"
};
```

### ⚠️ Important: basePath and siteUrl

The single most common deployment mistake is setting `basePath` wrong. Two scenarios:

| Your deployed URL | basePath | siteUrl |
|---|---|---|
| `https://dsutility.pages.dev/` | `/dspdf/` | `https://dsutility.pages.dev/` |
| `https://sudhankar.github.io/` | `/` | `https://sudhankar.github.io/` |
| `https://dspdf.com/` | `/` | `https://dspdf.com/` |

Also update these two files to match:
- `sitemap.xml` — find/replace `dsutility.pages.dev` with your real URL
- `robots.txt` — same

---

## Adding a new tool

Follow this recipe to add a tool page (example: `my-tool`):

### 1. Create the page

Copy any existing tool folder (e.g. `tools/rotate-pdf/`) and rename it to `tools/my-tool/`.

### 2. Update the HTML

In `tools/my-tool/index.html`, change:
- `<title>`, meta description, canonical, OG tags
- `<h1>`, intro paragraph, how-to steps, technical limitations, FAQ, related tools
- JSON-LD blocks (SoftwareApplication, BreadcrumbList, FAQPage)
- The upload zone ID, alert ID, progress ID, button IDs — any ID unique to this tool

### 3. Create the JS

Create `js/tools/my-tool.js` alongside the existing tools. Follow the pattern from `js/tools/rotate.js` or `merge.js`:

```javascript
(function () {
  "use strict";
  var D = window.DSUTILITY;      // shared engine (tools-engine.js)
  var log = window.dspdfLog; // debug logger

  // 1. Set up state
  // 2. Use D.UploadZone to wire up the drop area
  // 3. Use D.ProgressUI for the progress bar
  // 4. Use D.downloadBlob to deliver the output
  // 5. Handle errors via D.showError / D.humanError
})();
```

### 4. Register in the tools directory

Add a card to `tools/index.html` under the appropriate category heading.

### 5. Add to sitemap

Add a `<url>` entry in `sitemap.xml` with an appropriate priority.

### 6. Add to homepage (optional)

If the tool is a popular one, add a card to `index.html` in the "Popular PDF Tools" section.

---

## Adding a new blog article

### 1. Create the folder

```
mkdir blog/my-article-title
```

### 2. Copy the article template

Copy `blog/how-to-compress-pdf/index.html` and rename to `blog/my-article-title/index.html`.

### 3. Write your article

Replace the content inside `<article class="article">`. Keep:
- Breadcrumbs (`Home → Blog → Your Title`)
- `.eyebrow` category tag
- `<h1>` title
- `.article__meta` (author, date, read time)
- Body content with `<h2>` sections
- `.article__toc` table of contents (optional but recommended)
- FAQ section with `<details>` blocks
- `.article__byline` at the bottom

Update the JSON-LD at the top:
- `BlogPosting` with headline, description, dates, URL
- `BreadcrumbList`
- `FAQPage` if your article has an FAQ section

### 4. Add to blog index

Add a `<a class="post-card">` to `blog/index.html`.

### 5. Add to sitemap

Add a `<url>` entry in `sitemap.xml`.

---

## Updating the sitemap

Whenever you add a page, add a `<url>` block:

```xml
<url>
  <loc>https://dsutility.pages.dev/path/to/page/</loc>
  <changefreq>monthly</changefreq>
  <priority>0.7</priority>
</url>
```

Priorities used in this project:
- Homepage: 1.0
- Tools directory + PDF Editor + Compress: 0.9
- Individual tools: 0.6–0.8
- Blog index: 0.7
- Blog posts: 0.5–0.7
- About, FAQ: 0.6
- Legal pages: 0.3–0.4

---

## Enabling AdSense

1. Wait until AdSense approves your site (this requires real content and traffic — do not apply too early).
2. Google will give you a `ca-pub-XXXXXXXX` publisher ID.
3. Edit `js/config.js`:
   ```javascript
   adsenseEnabled: true,
   adsenseClient: "ca-pub-1234567890123456",
   ```
4. Update `ads.txt` with the exact line Google provides:
   ```
   google.com, pub-1234567890123456, DIRECT, f08c47fec0942fa0
   ```
5. Add the AdSense `<ins>` code inside the commented slots throughout the site. Each slot is marked:
   ```html
   <!-- AD SLOT: Leaderboard below header -->
   <!-- 👉 OWNER: Paste AdSense <ins> code here after approval -->
   ```

Ad slots exist in:
- Below header on homepage and tool pages
- After tool interfaces
- Inside blog content (after 2nd `<h2>`)
- Footer

**Never** place ads over tool buttons or inside the tool UI. This risks policy violations.

---

## Enabling analytics

Optional. Recommended provider: Plausible or Fathom (privacy-respecting), or Google Analytics 4 (free, more invasive).

Edit `js/config.js`:
```javascript
analyticsEnabled: true,
analyticsId: "G-XXXXXXXXXX",
```

Then add your analytics script snippet to `index.html` (and any page you want tracked) just before `</body>`, wrapped in a check for `DSUTILITY_CONFIG.analyticsEnabled`.

Since analytics is off by default, no tracking code runs unless you explicitly enable it.

---

## Customizing the design

### Colors

Open `css/style.css` and edit the CSS variables at the top:

```css
:root {
  --bg-dark: #0A1929;      /* page background (dark mode) */
  --accent:  #2563EB;      /* primary brand color */
  --success: #10B981;
  --danger:  #EF4444;
  /* ... etc */
}
```

Light-mode overrides are under `[data-theme="light"]`.

### Logo

Replace `images/logo.svg` and `images/favicon.svg` with your own. The wordmark uses `currentColor`, so it adapts to light/dark mode automatically.

### Typography

The site uses Inter from Google Fonts. To change it, edit the `<link>` tag in each page's `<head>` and update `--font-sans` in `css/style.css`.

## Browser support

Modern evergreen browsers:

- Chrome / Edge 90+
- Firefox 90+
- Safari 15+
- Mobile Safari (iOS 15+)
- Chrome for Android

Older browsers (Internet Explorer, pre-Chromium Edge) are not supported. Service workers and the File System Access API require modern browser versions.

---

## Known limitations

Documented honestly on the relevant tool pages, and repeated here for convenience:

- **Cannot edit existing PDF text.** No browser-based tool can, reliably. Our editor adds new content on top.
- **Custom fonts not supported in text tools.** Only standard PDF fonts (Helvetica, Times, Courier). Custom TTF embedding is on the roadmap.
- **Merge/split loses bookmarks and form fields.** Limitation of client-side pdf-lib.
- **Compression rasterizes pages.** Text becomes non-selectable after compression. Use OCR afterward to rebuild a text layer.
- **OCR struggles with handwriting.** Tesseract.js is trained on printed text. Accuracy figures on the OCR page.
- **Page reordering is not a standalone tool.** Currently achievable via extract + merge.
- **Protect PDF encryption depends on library support.** The tool checks at runtime and tells you honestly if it can't encrypt.
- **Redaction is only secure when rasterized.** Black boxes alone don't remove data.

## Testing checklist before deploying

- [ ] `js/config.js` — `basePath` and `siteUrl` set to your real deployment
- [ ] `sitemap.xml` — URLs updated to your real domain
- [ ] `robots.txt` — sitemap URL updated
- [ ] `images/logo.svg` and `images/favicon.svg` — replaced if customizing
- [ ] Open the site in a local server, verify homepage, tools directory, and a few tools work
- [ ] Verify a merge, a split, and a compress actually produce output
- [ ] Verify mobile layout (test at 375px width)
- [ ] Verify theme toggle persists
- [ ] Test with DevTools open — confirm no outgoing file uploads
- [ ] Test with internet disconnected after page load — confirm tools still work
